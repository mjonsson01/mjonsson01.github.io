        Current Work
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have been working on the NASA Artemis/Orion Crew Capsule flight software team since May of 2025. The Artemis 2 program marks the first major space mission I have contributed to, and I am having a great time!
        While on this project, I worked my way through various levels of software testing and verification (had to pay my dues, haha), until eventually landing work in GNC (Guidance Navigation & Control) analysis, which has been much more exciting ;)
        I also perform some duties in the R&D department for my contracting company on the side on our proprietary ML automated fault detection tool in both the embedded systems and the web-facing editions of the software.

    <h2>
        A Bit of Educational Background
    </h2>
    <p>
        I recently graduated with Honors from Trinity University in Spring of 2025. I obtained a B.S in Physics and Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics and
        Violin Performance. I completed a lengthy Honors project that involved a thesis write up at the end. My thesis project was largely an engineering appplication for a fluid dynamics experimentation device (see my 
        <a class="research-link" href="/Pages/Research/research.html"> Research </a> section), but I got my hands
        in a ton of novel areas throughout the project process. 
        I have a deep background in theoretical and applied mathematics and physics, and have used them to inform both my work and my hobbies. In school, I worked on original problems ranging from circuit design and construction of stepper motor microcontrollers
        from scratch, AI chess bots, fabricating physical macroscopic analogues to ion traps, plotting plant photosynthesis energy curves, and more.

    <h2>
        Some Musical Background
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have three brothers, all of whom are musically-trained, though I am the only violinist in the family. It's been a little while since I last picked up a big project piece, but I performed the Tchaikovsky violin concerto and the entirety of the Franck violin
        sonata for my Senior recital, which was a lot of fun. I also served as Trinity's concertmaster for three of my four years there. I plan to join the Clear Lake Symphony after my work schedule normalizes a bit more.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Other, More Random Stuff
    </h2>
    <p>
        I love cooking and experimenting in the kitchen. Might actually just start a recipes tab on this site bc it's a bit of a catch all. I still hop in the occasional road race as well, since I really enjoy running both as a way to stay healthy and socialize. I currently 
        am a member of the Good Guys Run Club in Downtown Houston.
