        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project was meant to imitate the classic arcade game of Galaga, but with an added functionality of rewinding time. This is achieved 
            by using a Scala/JavaFX libraries and some custom vector datatypes and GameStates to store information on a frame-by-frame basis, then preserving a Stack of GameStates and popping the contents of the Stack
            off when the rewinding functionality is triggered. Additional functionality includes scoring based on eliminating enemies and firing enemy bullets
            out of the air, collisions with enemies, accelerating enemy fire rate and movement speed by round and elimination count, and window flag management.

            I layed out framework to add powerups as well, including a rapid fire powerup and a teleportation powerup.

            <p>
                The first demo gif demonstrates the typical gameplay. Notice that the enemies acceleate as they get eliminated, and as the waves complete.

                The second demo gif shows the bullet block functionality. This is hard to pull off, so it results in a bonus to your score :)

                The last gif demonstrates the time rewinding functionality. It is limited by the GIF frame rate, but you can use it to undo any mistakes you make
                that cost you a life! Careful though, it can't revive you if you run out of lives!
