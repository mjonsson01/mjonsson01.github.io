    <h1>C Raytracing Demo</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            This demo showcases an interactive implementation of mathematical ray tracing and dynamic light occlusion 
            using C and SDL2. It allows you to see how rays interact with other objects in a scene. I am working on adding reflection capababilities
            as well as a menu to select objects to populate the screen with!

            The program uses a mathematical model to trace rays as they travel through a 3D scene. The GIF shows 
            the basic interaction of rays with objects and their reflections. It uses SDL2 for graphics rendering.

            Programmatical Heuristic Breakdown:
        </h2>
        <div class="p-section">
            First I initialized a graphical window using SDL2 library functionality, and defining some global constants for the height and width of the window.
        </div>
        <div class="p-section">
            Next, we made a RenderObject data structure, which our Circle struct can inherit some fields from like the x-y position, and the pointer to the collision detecttion. The RenderObject Parent type makes it far easier
            to add other shapes as this program expands. 
        </div>
        <div class="p-section">
            We then created a function called FillCircle, that allows us to fill in the circle for each frame generated for the SDL2 window. Essentially, it takes in the circle's position and radius,
             then generates a distance_squared value, to determine the locations of all the pixels it needs to fill with the specified colors. I also made use of the SDL2 Renderer, since it supports hardware acceleration, 
            and also prevents some amounts of overdrawing natively. It also allows use of V-Sync, a process that synchronizes the local display framerate with the generated frames, prevented frame stutters and hiccups.
            There are more elegant approaches to preventing frame stutter, but V-Sync worked well for the purposes of this project, as it does not need to be obscenely performant. 
        </div>
        <div class="p-section">
            After completing the render functions, we implement mouse events to make sure the objects are interactible, and add functions to both populate an array of LightRay structs, and also render them to a
             suitable cutoff distance.
        </div>

        <div class="p-section">
            Now to cut off the rays and create shadows, we calculate a special quadratic derived from combining the ray equation and circle equation as follows:
        
        <h2>Ray-Circle Intersection Equation</h2>

            <p>The ray equation is given by:</p>
            $$ (x, y) = (x_0 + t dx, y_0 + t dy) $$

            <p>The circle equation is:</p>
            $$ (x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 = r^2 $$

            <p>Substituting the ray equation:</p>
            $$ (x_0 + t dx - c_x)^2 + (y_0 + t dy - c_y)^2 = r^2 $$

            <p>Expanding and simplifying:</p>
            $$ A t^2 + B t + C = 0 $$

            <p>Where:</p>
            $$ A = dx^2 + dy^2 $$
            $$ B = 2 \left( dx (x_0 - c_x) + dy (y_0 - c_y) \right) $$
            $$ C = (x_0 - c_x)^2 + (y_0 - c_y)^2 - r^2 $$

            <p>The discriminant:</p>
            $$ D = B^2 - 4AC $$

            <p>Solving for \( t \):</p>
            $$ t_1 = \frac{-B - \sqrt{D}}{2A}, \quad t_2 = \frac{-B + \sqrt{D}}{2A} $$

            Which now permits us to determine the cutoff length multiplier in both the x and y-directions.
        </div>

        <div class="p-section">
            Lastly, we implement collision and collision detection by simply checking if the rendered boundary of the instance of the circle is colliding with the boundaries of another on screen object.
