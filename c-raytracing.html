    <h1>C Raytracing Demo</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            This demo showcases an interactive implementation of mathematical ray tracing and dynamic light occlusion 
            using C and SDL2. It allows you to see how rays interact with objects in a scene, including reflections and shadows.

            The program uses a mathematical model to trace rays as they travel through a 3D scene. The GIF shows 
            the basic interaction of rays with objects and their reflections. It uses SDL2 for graphics rendering.

            Programmatical Heuristic Breakdown:
        </h3>
        <div class="p-section">
            First I initialized a graphical window using SDL2 library functionality, and defining some global constants for the height and width of the window.
        </div>
        <div class="p-section">
            Next, we made a RenderObject data structure, which our Circle struct can inherit some fields from like the x-y position, and the pointer to the collision detecttion. The RenderObject Parent type makes it far easier
            to add other shapes as this program expands. 
        </div>
        <div class="p-section">
            We then created a function called FillCircle, that allows us to fill in the circle for each frame generated for the SDL2 window. Essentially, it takes in the circle's position and radius,
             then generates a distance_squared value, to determine the locations of all the pixels it needs to fill with the specified colors. I also made use of the SDL2 Renderer, since it supports hardware acceleration, 
            and also prevents some amounts of overdrawing natively. It also allows use of V-Sync, a process that synchronizes the local display framerate with the generated frames, prevented frame stutters and hiccups.
            There are more elegant approaches to preventing frame stutter, but V-Sync worked well for the purposes of this project, as it does not need to be obscenely performant.x
